"""
Driver for DATAQ DI-115 : 4-channel data acquisition starter kit

The DI-115 will show up as ACM device, ttyACM#, where # is a
number assigned by the operating system.  It can be found
by looking at dmesg output just after plugging device in,
you will see something like:
  [ 3593.252140] cdc_acm 3-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
In this case the device was assigned to /dev/ttyACM0

Also, you may need to change write/read permissions on
Linux device file, so non-root program can communicate
with sensor.
  sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

Usage: %(progname)s [-h] <serial_dev>

Options:
  serial_dev : serial device used to talk to device.
  -h : show this help

Example 1:
  %(progname)s /dev/ttyACM0
